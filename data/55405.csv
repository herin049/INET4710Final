This exquisite craftsman style East Isles home has been thoughtfully renovated with materials designed to match the vintage architecture and charm.  Originally built by E.J. Davis and Co. in 1906, this executive home is just 3 blocks from Lake of Isles.


As you enter the main level through the stone front porch you will notice interesting features like the custom designed drop-down boot bench in the foyer, beautiful ceilings inlaid with wood beams and crown molding, and leaded glass windows.  The original period architecture has been perfectly matched with the addition and renovations that include a gourmet eat-in kitchen, a &frac34; bathroom, family room with fireplace and a large entryway and mudroom off the back entry.  The original dining room, living room, fireplace, bookcases and sunroom have been impeccably preserved such that only the most discerning eye can find where the original home ends and the new renovations begin.


The upper levels of this 3-story walk-up include a magical owners suite with 3-sides of windows, walk-in closet and private full bath.  The central hall leads to three additional generous sized bedrooms and a lovely remodeled full bathroom.  The third level walk-up is an exceptional space for a home office, art studio, library or bedroom, with vaulted ceilings and skylights.


A visit to the lowest level is bright and open, terms seldom used to define this area in a turn of the century home.  With a mixture of original stone and modern finishes, the open family room with gas fireplace is cozy and inviting.  Just off the family room is a wine cellar, work out room, finished storage rooms and a wonderfully appointed laundry room.

This amazing home is positioned on a rare 1 &frac12; lots which provides unique privacy in the high demand East Isles neighborhood! This outdoor space is beautifully landscaped creating a wonderful retreat.

The exterior amenities are stunning. The deck is Brazilian zebrawood, installed using deck clips instead of screws. A custom designed Japanese style cedar fence and trellis lend privacy to the Jacuzzi spa and extensive paver patio and walkway. The insulated and sheetrocked garage offers additional storage and custom shelving. The roof was replaced with Timberline HD shingles in 2019 along with a landscape renovation that includes Gertens trees with a 5-year warranty.

Other notable features include: Greenlawn commercial irrigation system with in-line fertilizer, 5? commercial grade gutters with Leaf-X gutter guards, radon mitigation system, ADT wired security system with Sony color recording security camera, and a Carrier air conditioning system installed in 2016"
