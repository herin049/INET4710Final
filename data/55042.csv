As you enter, a two-story foyer presents a wow factor with its elegant chandelier and dramatic staircase leading to a catwalk above that overlooks the great room straight ahead.  Offering that extra needed space for hosting family and friends is a formal dining room on the left and living room on the right with a wet bar and French doors leading to a quaint office space.  The great room then showcases an impressive floor-to-ceiling, stone surround fireplace, plush carpet inlay, and walls of windows, allowing serene views of the treed backyard and loads of daylight to pour in.  From here, the open floor plan runs into the exquisite kitchen and informal dining space that lends access to a huge wrap around deck, running all the way from the laundry room on one end to the office on the other, while a private balcony deck above sits off the master suite.  This palatial space is a retreat with its luxurious bath remodeled with a tile surround jetted shower and whirlpool tub and gorgeous double vanities.  Three additional bedrooms and a full en suite, walk-thru bath are conveniently located on the upper level, while a mother-in-law suite can be found in the expansive walkout lower level.  With private access, your guests or family can feel at home in their own living quarter with a kitchen, remodeled &frac34; bath, family room with brick surround fireplace, bedroom and flex room.
